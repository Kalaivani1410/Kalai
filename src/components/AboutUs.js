      <h2>Who is JobBoard.com?</h2>
      <p>JobBoard.com is both a product and a trading name of HotLizard Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aspire Media Group.</p>
      
      <h3>A brief history</h3>
      <p>HotLizard was founded in 1999 in the UK and quickly established itself as a leading provider of recruitment websites and job board software.</p>
      <p>By combining technical & design excellence with innovation and a comprehensive market knowledge, HotLizard has built an impressive customer base - with many customers returning time-and-time again.</p>

      <p>The launch of JobBoard.com sees HotLizard providing a self-service, cloud-based product - whilst continuing to allow tailored solutions to customers with special, or bespoke requirements.
